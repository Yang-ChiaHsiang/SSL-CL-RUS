**Notice of Third-Party Code Usage**

This project incorporates the Patch-Level Contrastive Learning (PLCL) loss function based on the repository:

PatchCL-MedSeg by hritam-98  
GitHub: https://github.com/hritam-98/PatchCL-MedSeg

As of the time of publication, the original repository does not specify a license. Only the PLCL loss function and the core implementation idea are adapted in this project; all other modules are independently developed by Yang, Chia-Hsiang in 2025.

If the original author publishes an official license in the future, that license may apply to the reused portions accordingly.
